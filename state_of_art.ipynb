    "    abstract=\"Non-functional requirements (NFRs) are critical factors for software quality and success. A frequently reported challenge in agile requirements engineering is that NFRs are often neglected due to the focus on functional requirements (FRs) and the limited capability of agile requirements documented as user stories to represent NFRs. With the emergence of transfer learning and large pre-trained language models, various applications in requirements engineering have become feasible, alleviating several longstanding challenges. This study evaluates transformer-based models for the automated identification and classification of NFRs. We leveraged transfer learning with pre-trained transformer models to automate the identification and classification of NFRs in agile textual requirements documented as user stories. A dataset of over 10k user stories was collected and labeled, and pre-trained transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, and DistilBERT, were fine-tuned to automate the identification of NFRs. We incorporated Focal Loss during training to mitigate the dominance of functionally driven requirements and class imbalances. In addition, thorough experiments on hyperparameter optimization were employed using Bayesian hyperparameter optimization to obtain the combination of hyperparameters that best correlated with the aim of enhancing each model’s performance. Our evaluation demonstrated that the finetuned pre-trained models significantly outperformed comparable prior approaches relying on rule-based techniques or traditional machine learning, with a fine-tuned BERT model achieving an F1 Score of 93.4 %. These findings highlight the potential of pre-trained language models in agile requirements engineering, enabling more efficient NFRs identification, reducing manual review burden, and facilitating a viable and efficient approach to address the neglect of NFRs in agile development processes.\",\n",

    "    abstract=\"A critical step in the creation of software is the elicitation of requirements. According to most of the research, nonfunctional requirements get less attention from nonfunctional requirements, also necessary for the creation of every new application. A poor choice of elicitation causes the system to malfunction. Without the use of an elicitation approach, the needs and requirements of users cannot be ascertained. Ensuring efficient communication between analysts and users during the elicitation process is the biggest challenge for analysts. This study’s major artifact is a proposed model that creates a conceptual model automatically from a series of agile requirements given as user stories. The accuracy, especially when user stories are succinct assertions that identify the issue to be handled, was one of our case study’s positive outcomes. The objective was to prove that artificial intelligence can be used to elicit software requirements for software systems, and the findings support this claim. An elicitation model for NFR in agile methodology is proposed by this work. The approach will help the software business identify and collect needs for all kinds of software. as well as directing both users and developers in the development of software. Due to the elicitations of both FRs and NFRs of the initial phase in agile projects, which receive less attention, this study decreased the time, effort, and risk.\",\n",

    "    abstract=\"The ill-definition or neglect of non-functional requirements has been frequently reported as a problem in agile requirements engineering. Despite the importance of such requirements for the success of software projects, little research is available for reviewing them in the agile requirements. The few existing proposals are either too heavy-wight, lack agility assessment, or lack clarity on how to be embedded in an agile environment. These factors might reduce their adoption among agile practitioners. To address this problem, we propose a framework for reviewing non-functional requirements in the agile requirements formulated as user stories. Our proposed framework utilizes a combination of natural language processing and artificial intelligence techniques to automate analyzing and predicting non-functional requirements in user stories. Then, the artifacts needed for the requirements reading and reviewing technique are generated to assist requirements inspectors in reviewing non-functional requirements, identifying possible defects, and consequentially making a reasonably informed review decision. Our proposal aims to mitigate the most reported causes of the problem in the literature: the minimal documentation, the functionality-driven nature of agile requirements, and insufficient non-functional requirements knowledge.\",\n",

Some of these studies have proposed conceptual modeling as a solution to these problems. However, the effort that is required to create conceptual models conflicts with Agile values. In this paper, we propose an approach for using conceptual models in projects while adhering to Agile principles. This approach focuses on projects in which requirements are expressed as user stories that are the main artifacts of the requirements used for software development with Agile methods. First, the paper presents a literature review in which we have systematically searched for the challenges to requirements engineering with Agile methods. Next, we report on a survey study in which we interviewed 16 experts in the Agile methodology to confirm the identified challenges and find new ones that are not covered in the literature. Based on a thematic analysis of the challenges, we argue that most of them map to the two main purposes of using conceptual models in software development: improving communication and understanding requirements. To effectively use conceptual models in projects that use the Agile methodology, several conditions must be met, which we make explicit in the paper. The paper ends by illustrating how these conditions can be met demonstrating the models that can be automatically generated from a given set of user stories. This demonstration was subsequently used to obtain feedback from the experts on the perceived benefits of conceptual models in addressing the challenges of requirements engineering.\",\n",

A greater percentage of mobile app development (MAD) industries are turning to agile practices to increase app quality and shorten development times. Agile-based MAD relies heavily on efficient requirements gathering from stakeholders, and it has a significant impact on whether or not a mobile app is successful. Conventional methods of gathering requirements are typically labor-intensive and error-prone, prolonging the building process, driving up expenses and may struggle to maintain the track of frequent variations that characterize agile-based MAD. Machine learning (ML) approaches are becoming increasingly prevalent in gathering requirements as a means of automating the monotonous task of requirement engineering. The ability of ML approaches to process massive volumes of data, identify trends, and arrive at precise forecasts has the potential for significant advancement in gathering of requirements.

Many methodologies have been proposed, but the majority of them are focused on the waterfall approach, making adopting privacy engineering in agile software development difficult. The other major issue is that the process currently is to a high degree manual. This paper focuses on closing these gaps through the development of a machine learning-based approach for identifying privacy requirements in an agile software development environment, employing natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Our method aims to allow agile teams to focus on functional requirements while NLP tools assist them in generating privacy requirements. The main input for our method is a collection of user stories, which are typically used to identify functional requirements in agile software development. The NLP approach is then used to automate some human-intensive tasks such as identifying personal data and creating data flow diagrams from user stories. The data flow diagram forms the basis for the automatic creation of privacy requirements. Our evaluation shows that our NLP method achieves a fairly good performance in terms of F-Measure. We are also demonstrate the feasibility of our NLP approach in CamperPlus project. Lastly, we are developing a tool to integrate our NLP approach into the privacy requirements engineering pipeline, allowing for manual editing of results so that agile teams can maintain control over the automated approach.\",\n",

Nevertheless, development teams encounter the arduous task of dealing with the assortment of information expected from diverse sources to manually write user stories. This undertaking not only consumes a significant amount of time but is also susceptible to inaccuracies. We automatically generated user stories relying on two distinct approaches: N-gram representation with linguistic heuristics and the GPT-3 model. We evaluated our work by using diverse user stories corpora and calculating the metrics BLEU, ROUGE-N, and BERTScore for each set of user stories generated by both approaches. For the N-gram approach we achieved an average: ROUGE-N=0.39, BLEU=0.26, BERTScore=0.73; and for GPT-3 model: ROUGE-N=0.46, BLEU=0.27 and BERTScore=0.69.

Objective: Conduct a systematic literature review to capture the current state-of-the-art of NLP research on user stories. Method: The search strategy is used to obtain relevant papers from SCOPUS, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, SpringerLink, and Google Scholar. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are applied to filter the search results. We also use the forward and backward snowballing techniques to obtain more comprehensive results. Results: The search results identified 718 papers published between January 2009 to December 2020. After applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria and the snowballing technique, we identified 38 primary studies that discuss NLP techniques in user stories. Most studies used NLP techniques to extract aspects of who, what, and why from user stories. The purpose of NLP studies in user stories is broad, ranging from discovering defects, generating software artifacts, identifying the key abstraction of user stories, and tracing links between model and user stories. Conclusion: NLP can help system analysts manage user stories. Implementing NLP in user stories has many opportunities and challenges.

    "    abstract=\"Requirements engineering plays a significant role in successfully executing automotive projects. Due to critical factors like the high system complexity, the hardware-software-dependency and safety criticality, automotive software development is very different from traditional software engineering. It has long development cycles with late system integration and test phase, which leads to late customer feedback. This makes the process vulnerable to requirements engineering issues, e.g. insufficient or unclear requirements, late requirements changes, and in general, the high number and high complexity of requirements. The automotive industry is slowly adopting agile practices to encounter such issues, e.g. by introducing iterative, incremental development cycles. This contribution investigates the issues related to requirements engineering in automotive software development and proposes agile principles as a possible solution. Literature-based research identifies relevant root causes and process deficits regarding requirement-related issues. The paper also provides recommendations and solutions from agile methods for the identified issues and respective cause-and-effect chains. A survey with practitioners from five automotive companies has been conducted to check the validity of hypotheses about the issues and improvements. Literature findings and survey results conclude that adapting agile principles is a potential way to address requirement-related issues in automotive software development.\",\n",

    "    abstract=\"User stories are widely regarded as an effective method for articulating software requirements, especially within agile development. However, the brevity often encouraged in user stories can lead to a lack of detail, resulting in miscommunication and inefficiencies during development. A significant challenge is the manual extraction of user stories from unstructured text, which is labor-intensive and prone to errors. Automated extraction using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning offers a promising solution. These technologies can identify and extract user roles, actions, and benefits from unstructured text, reducing the reliance on manual intervention and ensuring consistent quality. We conducted a literature review spanning the past 20 years, from 2004 to 2024, on which we identified 77 relevant articles, with only 10 focusing on the extraction of user stories using NLP techniques. These studies emphasize the need for automation in user story extraction to improve the efficiency and accuracy of requirements gathering. The findings highlight a gap in current research regarding automated extraction methods and the importance of addressing this through advanced NLP techniques. Implementing such solutions can transform the handling of user stories, making the requirements elicitation process more efficient and less error-prone, ultimately contributing to the success of agile software development projects.\",\n",

In this paper, we detail a workflow process that leverages the concept of rubber duck debugging, replacing the duck with a capable LLM, e.g., GPT-4. We call it Digital Rubber Duck Programming. Furthermore, the Extreme Programming (XP) method, an implementation of the Agile paradigm, is considered as easily integrated with the proposed workflow, as XP is performed in pairs (much like the modern software engineer works in pairwise fashion with an LLM) and because XP places emphasis on performing extensive code reviews and unit testing all code, which capable LLMs like GPT-4 can facilitate.\",\n",

    "    abstract=\"This innovative practice full paper explores the use of AI technologies in user story generation. With the emergence of agile software development, generating comprehensive user stories that capture all necessary functionalities and perspectives has become crucial for software development. Every computing program in the United States requires a semester-or year-long senior capstone project, which requires student teams to gather and document technical requirements. Effective user story generation is crucial for successfully implementing software projects. However, user stories written in natural language can be prone to inherent defects such as incompleteness and incorrectness, which may creep in during the downstream development activities like software designs, construction, and testing. One of the challenges faced by software engineering educators is to teach students how to elicit and document requirements, which serve as a blueprint for software development. Advanced AI technologies have increased the popularity of large language models (LLMs) trained on large multimodal datasets. Therefore, utilizing LLM-based techniques can assist educators in helping students discover aspects of user stories that may have been overlooked or missed during the manual analysis of requirements from various stakeholders. The main goal of this research study is to investigate the potential application of OpenAI techniques in software development courses at two academic institutions to enhance software design and development processes, aiming to improve innovation and efficiency in team project-based educational settings. The data used for the study constitute student teams generating user stories by traditional methods (control) vs. student teams using OpenAI agents (treatment) such as gpt-4-turbo for generating user stories. The overarching research questions include: RQ-l) What aspects of user stories generated using OpenAI prompt engineering differ significantly from those generated using the traditional method? RQ-2) Can the prompt engineering data provide insights into the efficacy of the questions/prompts that affect the quality and comprehensiveness of user stories created by software development teams? Industry experts evaluated the user stories created and analyzed how prompt engineering affects the overall effectiveness and innovation of user story creation, which provided guidelines for incorporating AI-driven approaches into software development practices. Overall, this research seeks to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on the application of AI in software engineering education, specifically in user story generation. Investigating the use of AI technologies in user story generation could further enhance the usability of prompt engineering in agile software development environments. We plan to expand the study to investigate the long-term effects of prompt engineering on all phases of software development.\",\n",

Currently, only a limited number of secondary studies have reviewed the research on the user story technique. These research reviews focused on specific research topics related to ambiguity of requirements, effort estimation, and the application of Natural Language Processing. To our knowledge, a systematic mapping of all user story research has not been performed. To this end, we study the academic literature to investigate what user stories research has been performed, what types of problems have been identified, what sort of solutions or other types of research outcomes have been achieved, how mature the research is, and what research gaps exist. We followed Systematic Mapping Study guidelines to synthesize the currently available academic research on user stories. In total, we found 186 unique peer-reviewed studies, published in the period 2001-2021. We observed that research on the user story technique and its use had grown exponentially over the last seven years. Further, using a five-dimensional classification framework– requirements engineering activity, problem class, outcome class, type of research, type of publication– we observed several patterns in the classification of these studies across the different framework dimensions, which provided insights into the state-of-the-art and maturity of the research. We also identified four research gaps: the paucity of focused literature reviews; a lack of research on the role that user stories play in human cognition and interaction; a lack of comprehensive and mature solutions for resolving ambiguity issues with user stories early in the project; and a lack of validation and evaluation of proposed solutions. Several research opportunities are suggested, making our paper a useful reference for future research on user stories allowing researchers to clearly position their contributions.\",\n",

Using design science research, we collaborated for over 1.5 years with four organizations applying ASD. Involving a total of 35 practitioners, we designed new evidence-based quality-aware ASD processes, which were validated through simulated scenarios, implemented, and evaluated by the practitioners. A general ASD process model, derived from the company-specific models, was created; it shows activities, artifacts, roles, and development phases where evidence can be used to improve software quality. The new process model contributed to higher quality awareness, improved bottleneck identification, release readiness, and quality issues prioritization in the studied companies. We also learned that companies must be mindful of the rules that determine the use of evidence. Integrating the use of quality related evidence into the ASD process can make it quality-aware, support software quality management, and enable timely reaction through fast feedback loops. The evidence-based quality-aware ASD process is applicable in any Scrum-like ASD process. Applicability in other forms of ASD, however, requires further research.\",\n",

The process consists of three steps: 1) eliciting an interaction statement that describes a critical action performed by a user or system process; 2) eliciting one or more descriptive statements about a technology that enables the interaction; and 3) refinement of the technology into technical variants that correspond to design alternatives. We empirically evaluated our method by implementing our prototype in a user study that collects 30 security scenarios from participants. Based on our analysis, our proposed method is shown effective. Participants had a 100 percent task completion rate with 57 percent of participants achieving complete task-success, and the remaining 43 percent of participants achieving partial task-success.

    "    abstract=\"Over the past decade, app store (AppStore)-inspired requirements elicitation has proven to be highly beneficial. Developers often explore competitors’ apps to gather inspiration for new features. With the advance of Generative AI, recent studies have demonstrated the potential of large language model (LLM)-inspired requirements elicitation. LLMs can assist in this process by providing inspiration for new feature ideas. While both approaches are gaining popularity in practice, there is a lack of insight into their differences. We report on a comparative study between AppStore- and LLM-based approaches for refining features into sub-features. By manually analyzing 1,200 sub-features recommended from both approaches, we identified their benefits, challenges, and key differences. While both approaches recommend highly relevant sub-features with clear descriptions, LLMs seem more powerful particularly concerning novel unseen app scopes. Moreover, some recommended features are imaginary with unclear feasibility, which suggests the importance of a human-analyst in the elicitation loop.CCS CONCEPTS• Software and its engineering → Requirements analysis; • Computing methodologies → Natural language processing.\",\n",

    "    abstract=\"In this work, we address the challenge of incorporating human preferences into the task-scheduling process for human-robot teams. Humans have various individual preferences that can be influenced by context and situational information. Incorporating these preferences can lead to improved team performance. Our main contribution is a framework that helps elicit and incorporate preferences during task scheduling. We achieve this by proposing 1) a constraint programming method to generate a range of plans, 2) an intelligent approach for selecting and presenting task schedules based on task features, and 3) a preference incorporation method that uses large language models to convert preferences into soft constraints. Our results demonstrate that we can efficiently generate diverse plans for preference elicitation and incorporate them into the task-scheduling process. We evaluate our framework using an assembly-inspired case study and show how it can effectively incorporate complex and realistic preferences. Our implementation can be found at github.com/RROS-Lab/Human-Robot-Preference-Planning.\",\n",
